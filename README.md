# Smart-Attendance-System
<br>
The Smart Attendance Management System is a web application designed to automate and authenticate the student attendance process. Traditional attendance methods such as paper-based registers or manual calling are inefficient and vulnerable to proxy attendance. 
This system utilizes modern technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Geolocation API, and browser storage to mark and record attendance securely and accurately. It automatically detects the student’s real-time location and validates whether they are inside the authorized campus area. Only then are they allowed to mark their attendance. 
The system features role-based dashboards for Students and Teachers, real-time location checking, attendance history, analytics, and CSV export for reporting.
